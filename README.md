# Spring-Hackathon-2024
Club Nest

Connects students to club information by creating a cohesive platform that includes a calendar, group chat, and previous meeting presentations/flyers. Fixes the issue of each club using their own platform such as discord, groupme, or slack and making it one website for all by combining the functional and familiar UI of d2l. 

MVP: basic html/css page that includes a home page and 3 mock clubs 

Subsequent iteration: 
Partner with schools to provide the data directly
Include a campus map with gps to club meeting locations
Create an app version
