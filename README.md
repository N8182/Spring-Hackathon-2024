# Spring-Hackathon-2024
Club Nest

Connects students to club information by creating a cohesive platform that includes a calendar, group chat, and previous meeting presentations/flyers. Fixes the issue of each club using their own platform such as discord, groupme, or slack and making it one website for all by combining the functional and familiar UI of d2l. 

MVP Features
- Home Page: A welcoming entry point that outlines the platform's purpose and guides users to club information.
- Three Mock Clubs: Demonstrates the platform's capability to support multiple clubs with individual pages.
- Basic HTML/CSS Design: Ensures accessibility and ease of navigation, laying the groundwork for further development.

Planned Enhancements
Direct School Partnerships: To streamline the flow of club information and updates directly from school administrations.
Campus Map with GPS: For easy navigation to club meeting locations.
Mobile Application: To increase accessibility and convenience for students on the go.
